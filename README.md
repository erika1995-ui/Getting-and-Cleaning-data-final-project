# Getting-and-Cleaning-data-final-project
This repo contains the final project of the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data".
In this repo you'll find different files that allows you to run and understand how to create a tidy data set on Human Activity recognition data. The main data comes from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.

The files in this repo are:
1. run_analysis.R code: that gives you the tidy dataset of Human Activity Recognition after five steps:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
2. New_Tidy_Data.txt: that contains the final tidy data after all the processing chain [1-5]
3. CodeBook.md that describes all the names and variables used in this project
